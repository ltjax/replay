{{{
  ostream& replay::obstream< ostream >::stream
}}}
  
====obstream====
{{{
  replay::obstream< ostream >::obstream(ostream &internal)
}}}
  Construct the stream wrapper. 
====operator<<====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::operator<<(const std::string &x)
}}}
  Writing operator for strings. 
====operator<<====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::operator<<(const double &x)
}}}
  Writing operator for doubles. 
====operator<<====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::operator<<(unsigned char x)
}}}
  Writing operator for unsigned chars. 
====operator<<====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::operator<<(signed short x)
}}}

====seekg====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::seekg(std::ios::off_type offset, std::ios_base::seekdir way)
}}}
  Seek to a relative position in the stream. offsetThe offset to seek to, this is relative to the way parameter. wayThe seek direction, can be ios_base::beg, ios_base::cur or ios_base::end. *this 
====seekg====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::seekg(std::ios::pos_type position)
}}}
  Seek to an absolute position in the stream. positionThe streampos object position to seek to. *this 
====write====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::write(const void *pointer, std::streamsize s)
}}}
  Write to the stream. pointerPointer to the stream. sSize *this 
====write====
{{{
  obstream& replay::obstream< ostream >::write(const datatype &x)
}}}
  Writes to the stream, size is calculated from the type. xThe stream to write to. *this
